  - Run server with `NOTIFY_MCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE=http` environment variable
  - Multi-client session management for concurrent AI assistant connections
  - Remote access from anywhere on the network
  - Cloud deployment ready (Railway, Render, Fly.io, AWS, Docker)
  - HTTP endpoint: `http://<host>:<port>/mcp`
- **Transport Configuration**: New environment variables for HTTP transport
  - `NOTIFY_MCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE`: Choose between "stdio" (default) or "http"
  - `NOTIFY_MCP_HTTP_HOST`: HTTP server host address (default: 0.0.0.0)
  - `NOTIFY_MCP_HTTP_PORT`: HTTP server port (default: 8000)
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive HTTP deployment guide
  - Local network deployment instructions
  - Cloud platform deployment guides (Railway, Render, Fly.io, AWS EC2)
  - Docker deployment configuration
  - Security recommendations and best practices
  - Performance tuning guidance
- **Examples**: Added `examples/run_http_server.py` for standalone HTTP server
- **Tests**: Added 7 new HTTP transport integration tests (69 total tests)

### Changed
- **Server Architecture**: Refactored to support dual transport (stdio + HTTP)
  - Added `run_stdio()`, `run_http()`, and updated `run()` methods
  - Converted `current_client_id` to property for multi-client support
  - Added `active_clients` dictionary for session tracking
  - Added `_client_context` for request-scoped client identification
- **Configuration**: Updated Pydantic settings to use `ConfigDict` (Pydantic v2 style)
- **Documentation**: Updated README with HTTP transport configuration and features
  - Added HTTP transport section with configuration examples
  - Updated roadmap: Phase 2B marked as complete
  - Added security note about no authentication in Community Edition

### Fixed
- Fixed Pydantic deprecation warning in `TransportSettings`

### Security
- **Important**: Community Edition HTTP transport has **no authentication**
  - Recommended for use on private/internal networks only
  - Use VPN for remote access
  - Configure firewall to restrict access
  - For production deployments with authentication, upgrade to Enterprise Edition

### Compatibility
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing stdio transport continues to work (default)
- **Python**: Requires Python 3.11+
- **MCP SDK**: v1.17.0+ (Streamable HTTP support)
- **Dependencies**: Added `starlette` and `uvicorn` (already included as MCP SDK dependencies)

### Performance
- **Concurrent Users**: Community Edition with SQLite supports 5-20 concurrent users
- **Scalability**: For 20-100+ users, upgrade to Enterprise Edition with PostgreSQL
