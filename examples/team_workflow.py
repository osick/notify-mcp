"""Team collaboration workflow example.

This example demonstrates a realistic team workflow:
1. Setting up channels for different teams (dev, consulting, business)
2. Team members subscribing with role-specific filters
3. Broadcasting architecture decisions
4. Sending critical alerts
5. Sharing status updates
6. Cross-team coordination

This simulates how different team roles would use notify-mcp for
collaboration across AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini).

Prerequisites:
- notify-mcp server running
- MCP client library installed: pip install mcp

## Context
Our monolithic application is becoming difficult to scale and maintain.
Different teams need to deploy independently.

## Decision
We will migrate to a microservices architecture using Docker and Kubernetes.

## Key Services
- User Service (authentication, profiles)
- Order Service (order processing, fulfillment)
- Payment Service (payment processing, billing)
- Notification Service (emails, push notifications)

## Timeline
- Phase 1 (Q1): User Service extraction
- Phase 2 (Q2): Order Service extraction
- Phase 3 (Q3): Payment Service extraction

## Impact
- All teams must adopt Docker for local development
- CI/CD pipeline updates required
- Service communication via REST APIs initially, gRPC later

## Next Steps
1. Review service boundaries
2. Define API contracts
3. Set up development environments

## Severity: CRITICAL
**Time:** 2024-01-15 14:32 UTC

## Issue
Production database connection pool has reached maximum capacity.
New requests are being rejected.

## Impact
- API response time degraded by 300%
- 15% of requests failing with 503 errors
- User login and checkout flows affected

## Immediate Actions Required
1. Scale database connection pool (temporary fix)
2. Investigate connection leaks in Order Service
3. Review slow queries consuming connections

## Current Status
- Incident Response Team has been notified
- Monitoring dashboards: https://grafana.example.com/incidents/db-pool
- War room: #incident-response (Slack)

## Updates
Will provide updates every 15 minutes in this channel.

## Context
Based on customer feedback and market analysis, we're adjusting our Q1 priorities.

## New Top Priorities
1. **Mobile App Push Notifications** (moved up from P2 to P1)
   - Customer retention impact: High
   - Requested by 78% of surveyed users
   - Competitive differentiation

2. **Social Media Integration** (moved up from P3 to P2)
   - Marketing team requirement
   - Viral growth potential

3. **Advanced Reporting** (moved down from P1 to P3)
   - Deferred to Q2 based on sales pipeline

## Impact on Development
- Mobile team: Shift focus to push notifications
- Backend team: API changes needed for social integration
- Frontend team: UI updates for social sharing

## Timeline
- Push notifications: 3 weeks (critical path)
- Social integration: 4 weeks
- Requirements workshop: Next Monday 10am

## Questions?
Reach out to Product team for clarification.

## Project Overview
Technical assessment for Client Alpha's modernization project.

## Key Findings
1. **Legacy System Analysis**
   - 15-year-old monolithic PHP application
   - No automated tests
   - Manual deployment process
   - Database performance issues

2. **Recommended Approach**
   - Strangler pattern for gradual migration
   - Extract user authentication service first (highest ROI)
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline
   - Modernize frontend with React

3. **Estimated Effort**
   - Phase 1 (6 months): Authentication service + CI/CD
   - Phase 2 (8 months): Core business logic extraction
   - Phase 3 (4 months): Frontend modernization

## Budget Impact
- Original estimate: $450K
- Revised estimate: $520K (scope expansion)
- Client approved budget increase

## Next Steps
- Present architecture proposal to client CTO (Friday)
- Finalize statement of work
- Team allocation planning

## Team Requirements
- 2 Senior Backend Developers
- 1 DevOps Engineer
- 1 Frontend Developer (starting Phase 3)
