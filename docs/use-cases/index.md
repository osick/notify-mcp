# Use Cases & Scenarios

Notify-MCP shines in team collaboration scenarios where information needs to flow seamlessly across different AI assistants and team members. This section explores real-world use cases that demonstrate the value of cross-platform notification sharing.

---

## Overview

The power of Notify-MCP comes from solving a fundamental problem in modern AI-assisted development: **information silos**.

When team members use different AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini), they often work in isolation. Important decisions, updates, and alerts don't propagate across the team, leading to:

- ‚ùå Duplicated research and work
- ‚ùå Missed critical updates
- ‚ùå Inconsistent understanding of project state
- ‚ùå Delayed incident response
- ‚ùå Poor cross-team coordination

Notify-MCP solves this by providing a **unified notification layer** that works across all AI platforms.
