# Incident Response & Alerts

**Problem:** During production incidents, teams struggle to coordinate response efforts when using different AI assistants. Critical alerts get missed, context is lost, and response time suffers because incident information doesn't flow seamlessly across platforms.

**Solution:** Notify-MCP provides a unified alert notification system that ensures critical incidents reach all team members instantly, regardless of which AI platform they're using‚Äîdramatically reducing mean time to resolution (MTTR).

---

## The Challenge

Production incidents create chaos when teams lack unified communication:

- **DevOps engineer (using Claude)** detects critical database failure at 2 AM
- **On-call developer (using ChatGPT)** doesn't see the alert for 15 minutes
- **Backend team lead (using Gemini)** wakes up hours later with zero context
- **Incident Commander** can't get a complete picture of who's responding

This incident response fragmentation causes:

- ‚ùå Delayed incident detection and response
- ‚ùå Lost context during handoffs
- ‚ùå Duplicated troubleshooting efforts
- ‚ùå Incomplete incident timelines for post-mortems
- ‚ùå Increased MTTR (Mean Time To Resolution)

---

## How Notify-MCP Solves This

### Instant Alert Broadcasting

When any team member detects an incident through their AI assistant, critical alerts reach everyone immediately‚Äîno platform barriers.

### Persistent Incident Timeline

All incident-related notifications are stored, creating a complete timeline for post-mortem analysis.

### Cross-Platform War Room

Team members using different AI assistants collaborate seamlessly during incident response.

### Priority-Based Alerting

Critical (P0) incidents trigger high-priority notifications that cut through the noise.

### Automated Incident Context

AI assistants can retrieve complete incident history and current status instantly.

---

## Implementation Guide

### 1. Create Incidents Channel

```markdown
# Setup incidents channel for production alerts
"Create a channel called 'incidents' for production incident coordination"
```

### 2. Configure Monitoring Integration

Integrate monitoring tools (Datadog, New Relic, Grafana) to publish alerts:

```python
# Example: Monitoring webhook ‚Üí Notify-MCP
def send_incident_alert(alert_data):
    notification = {
        "channel": "incidents",
        "title": f"üö® {alert_data['severity']}: {alert_data['title']}",
        "body": format_alert_details(alert_data),
        "priority": map_severity_to_priority(alert_data['severity']),
        "theme": "incident-alert",
        "tags": [alert_data['severity'].lower(), alert_data['service']],
    }
    # Publish via MCP
```

### 3. Establish Incident Severity Levels

```markdown
**P0 (Critical):** Priority = "critical"
- Production down
- Data loss
- Security breach

**P1 (High):** Priority = "high"
- Degraded performance
- Partial outage
- Customer-facing errors

**P2 (Medium):** Priority = "medium"
- Minor issues
- Non-customer facing
- Performance degradation

**P3 (Low):** Priority = "low"
- Monitoring alerts
- Non-urgent issues
- Informational
```

### 4. Define Incident Notification Themes

```markdown
"incident-alert"      - Initial incident detection
"incident-update"     - Status updates during response
"incident-decision"   - Key decisions (approvals, strategy changes)
"incident-resolved"   - Incident resolution
"incident-postmortem" - Post-mortem analysis
```

### 5. Set Up On-Call Subscriptions

```markdown
# On-call engineer subscribes with critical priority filter
"Subscribe me to 'incidents' channel, critical and high priority only"
```

---

## Incident Response Patterns

### Pattern 1: Immediate Acknowledgment

```markdown
# First responder ALWAYS acknowledges within 2 minutes
{
  "title": "üëÄ Incident Acknowledged",
  "body": "**Owner:** [Name]\n**Status:** Investigating\n**ETA:** [Timeline]",
  "theme": "incident-update"
}
```

### Pattern 2: Regular Status Updates

```markdown
# Update every 5-10 minutes during active incidents
{
  "title": "üìä Status Update - [Summary]",
  "body": "**Progress:** [Current actions]\n**Findings:** [What we know]\n
  **Next:** [Next steps]",
  "theme": "incident-update"
}
```

### Pattern 3: Escalation

```markdown
# Escalate when incident severity increases or help needed
{
  "title": "‚¨ÜÔ∏è ESCALATION: Need [Team/Person]",
  "body": "**Reason:** [Why escalating]\n**Urgency:** [How urgent]\n
  **Context:** [What they need to know]",
  "priority": "critical",
  "theme": "incident-escalation"
}
```

### Pattern 4: Resolution

```markdown
# Always publish resolution with summary
{
  "title": "‚úÖ RESOLVED: [Incident Title]",
  "body": "**Duration:** [Time]\n**Cause:** [Root cause]\n**Fix:** [What fixed it]\n
  **Impact:** [User/business impact]\n**Next Steps:** [Follow-up actions]",
  "theme": "incident-resolved"
}
```

## Advanced Incident Scenarios

### Multi-Team Incident

**Database team needs application team help:**

```markdown
{
  "channel": "incidents",
  "title": "üÜò Need Application Team: Abnormal Query Pattern",
  "body": "Database under heavy load. Seeing unusual query pattern from user-service.
  Need application team to investigate recent code changes.\n\n**Evidence:** [Query logs]",
  "priority": "critical",
  "tags": ["p0", "needs-app-team"],
  "thread_id": "incident-xyz"
}
```

**Application team responds in same thread:**

```markdown
{
  "title": "üîç App Team Investigating",
  "body": "Found N+1 query introduced in recent deployment. Rolling back now.",
  "in_reply_to": "msg-database-team",
  "thread_id": "incident-xyz"
}
```

### Security Incident

**Security team detects breach attempt:**

```markdown
{
  "channel": "security-incidents",  # Separate high-security channel
  "title": "üîê SECURITY INCIDENT: Brute Force Attack Detected",
  "body": "**Severity:** P0\n**Attack Type:** Credential stuffing\n**Target:**
  Login endpoints\n**Rate:** 10,000 attempts/minute\n\n**CONFIDENTIAL** - Do not
  discuss publicly",
  "priority": "critical",
  "theme": "security-incident",
  "tags": ["p0", "security", "confidential"]
}
```

### Cascading Failure

**Initial incident triggers secondary issues:**

```markdown
# Primary incident
{
  "title": "üö® P0: Database Failure",
  "thread_id": "incident-primary"
}

# Cascading impact
{
  "title": "‚ö†Ô∏è Secondary Impact: Cache Service Degraded",
  "body": "Cache service struggling due to database failure. Seeing elevated
  miss rate and latency.",
  "thread_id": "incident-primary",  # Link to primary
  "tags": ["p1", "secondary-impact"]
}
```

---

## Post-Incident Analysis

### Generate Timeline from Notifications

```markdown
# After incident, AI assistant can generate timeline
"Generate an incident timeline from thread 'incident-2024-01-12-001'"

# Result:
## Incident Timeline

- **2:47 AM** - Monitoring detected database connection pool exhaustion
- **2:48 AM** - Sarah Chen acknowledged, began investigation
- **2:52 AM** - Root cause identified: connection leak in v2.4.3
- **2:53 AM** - Tom Rodriguez approved rollback
- **2:55 AM** - Rollback initiated
- **2:59 AM** - Services recovered, incident resolved

**Total Duration:** 12 minutes
**MTTR:** 8 minutes
```

### Extract Key Decisions

```markdown
"Show all incident-decision notifications from last week"

# Result: All critical decisions made during incidents
- Rollback approvals
- Escalation decisions
- Mitigation strategy choices
```

### Identify Patterns

```markdown
"How many P0 incidents did we have this month?"

# Notify-MCP provides data:
- Total P0 incidents: 4
- Average MTTR: 15 minutes
- Most common cause: Deployment issues (3/4)
- Fastest resolution: 8 minutes
- Slowest resolution: 28 minutes
```

---

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Do This

- **Acknowledge immediately** - First responder confirms within 2 minutes
- **Update frequently** - Status updates every 5-10 minutes during active incidents
- **Use threads** - Keep related updates in same thread_id
- **Clear resolution** - Always publish when incident is resolved
- **Preserve context** - Include links to logs, dashboards, commits

### ‚ùå Avoid This

- **Don't go silent** - Regular updates even if "still investigating"
- **Don't skip resolution** - Always confirm incident is resolved
- **Don't forget priority** - P0 = critical, P1 = high, etc.
- **Don't lose thread** - Use thread_id to group related notifications
- **Don't mix incidents** - Each incident gets its own thread_id

---

## Integration with Incident Management Tools

### PagerDuty

```markdown
# PagerDuty triggers Notify-MCP notification
PagerDuty Alert ‚Üí Notify-MCP ‚Üí All AI Assistants

# Notify-MCP updates PagerDuty
Incident Resolved in Notify-MCP ‚Üí Update PagerDuty incident status
```

### Opsgenie

```markdown
# Bidirectional sync
Opsgenie Alert ‚Üí Notify-MCP notification
Notify-MCP resolution ‚Üí Close Opsgenie alert
```

### Statuspage

```markdown
# Publish to Statuspage when customer-facing
P0 Incident ‚Üí Notify-MCP ‚Üí Auto-update Statuspage
```
