# Cross-Platform AI Collaboration

**Problem:** Teams use different AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity) based on personal preference, specialty, or availability—creating information silos where critical knowledge stays trapped in individual AI conversations.

**Solution:** Notify-MCP breaks down AI platform barriers by providing a unified notification layer that works seamlessly across all MCP-compatible AI assistants, enabling true cross-platform collaboration.

---

## The Challenge

Modern teams leverage multiple AI platforms, but face fragmentation:

- **Developer A** has critical insights from Claude Code sessions that **Developer B** (using ChatGPT) never sees
- **Designer using Gemini** makes UI decisions that **Frontend team using Claude** discovers weeks later
- **Data Scientist using Perplexity** finds important research that stays siloed in their conversation
- **Team knowledge** scattered across incompatible platforms with no way to share

This AI platform fragmentation causes:

- ❌ Duplicated research across team members
- ❌ Lost insights and discoveries
- ❌ Inconsistent understanding of project state
- ❌ Wasted time rediscovering the same information
- ❌ Inability to leverage each AI's unique strengths together

---

## How Notify-MCP Solves This

### Platform-Agnostic Communication

Any AI assistant can publish to and subscribe from Notify-MCP channels—no platform lock-in.

### Unified Knowledge Base

Insights from Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, and others all flow into a single, searchable notification history.

## Real-World Scenario

### Scenario: Cross-Functional AI Team Building E-Commerce Platform

**Team:** 6 people using different AI assistants based on their needs and preferences

**AI Platform Distribution:**
- **Alice (Backend Lead):** Claude Code (best for backend development)
- **Bob (Frontend Dev):** ChatGPT Plus (preferred for React)
- **Carol (Designer):** Gemini (excellent for creative work)
- **David (DevOps):** Claude (great for infrastructure as code)
- **Emma (Data Analyst):** Perplexity (superior research capabilities)
- **Frank (Product Manager):** ChatGPT (accessible, good for planning)

---

### Day 1: Backend Architectural Decision (Claude)

**Alice (Backend Lead, using Claude Code):**

```markdown
Alice: "I need to decide between PostgreSQL and MongoDB for our e-commerce
database. Let's discuss this."

Claude: "Let me analyze both options... Based on your e-commerce requirements
(ACID transactions, relational data, complex queries), I recommend PostgreSQL.
Shall I publish this architectural decision?"

Alice: "Yes, publish it to the architecture channel so the whole team knows."

# Notification sent via Claude:
{
  "channel": "architecture",
  "title": "Database Decision: PostgreSQL Selected",
  "body": "## Decision\n\nUsing PostgreSQL for e-commerce platform database.\n\n
  ## Rationale\n\n**PostgreSQL chosen over MongoDB because:**\n- ACID transactions
  critical for order processing\n- Relational data model (users, orders, products)\n
  - Complex JOIN queries for analytics\n- JSON support available for flexible
  fields\n- Better consistency guarantees\n\n## Impact\n\n- Backend: Using
  SQLAlchemy ORM\n- DevOps: Postgres container in Docker Compose\n- Data team:
  SQL queries for analytics\n\nTeam: Please design your components with relational
  model in mind.",

  }
}
```

---

### Day 1 (2 hours later): Frontend Developer Sees Decision (ChatGPT)

**Bob (Frontend Dev, using ChatGPT Plus):**

```markdown
Bob: "Are there any architecture decisions I should know about for the e-commerce
project?"

ChatGPT: "Yes! Alice made a database decision 2 hours ago. She selected PostgreSQL
over MongoDB for ACID transactions and relational data modeling. This affects
your frontend because:

1. API will return relational data structures
2. GraphQL might be a good fit for complex queries
3. You can expect strong consistency guarantees

The backend is using SQLAlchemy ORM. Would you like me to help design the API
interface?"

Bob: "Perfect! Yes, let's design the API with that in mind."
```

---

### Day 2: Design System Research (Gemini)

**Carol (Designer, using Gemini):**

```markdown
Carol: "I've been researching e-commerce design patterns. What are the best
practices for product listing pages?"

Gemini: "I've found excellent research on e-commerce UX patterns... [extensive
analysis]. The key findings suggest a card-based layout with lazy loading and
quick-view functionality performs best."

Carol: "This is valuable for the whole team. Publish these design insights."

# Notification sent via Gemini:
