# Architecture & Technical Decisions

**Problem:** When technical decisions are made, they often remain siloed in individual conversations with AI assistants. Team members working with different AI tools miss crucial context about why certain architectural choices were made, leading to inconsistent implementations and repeated debates.

**Solution:** Notify-MCP provides a unified notification layer for broadcasting architectural decisions across all AI platforms, creating a searchable, persistent record of technical choices.

---

## The Challenge

Modern development teams face a critical problem:

- **Developer A** asks Claude about microservices architecture and makes a decision
- **Developer B** asks ChatGPT about the same issue hours later, unaware of Developer A's decision
- **Developer C** discusses database choices with Gemini, missing both previous conversations
- **Result:** Inconsistent implementations, duplicated research, conflicting approaches

This information fragmentation causes:

- ‚ùå Architectural drift across the codebase
- ‚ùå Repeated research on solved problems
- ‚ùå Lost context about decision rationale
- ‚ùå Difficulty onboarding new team members
- ‚ùå Inconsistent technical approaches

---

## How Notify-MCP Solves This

### Unified Decision Broadcast

When any team member makes an architectural decision with their AI assistant, it's automatically shared with everyone‚Äîregardless of which AI platform they use.

### Searchable History

All decisions are stored persistently (SQLite/PostgreSQL), creating a queryable knowledge base of architectural choices.

### Rich Context Preservation

Each decision includes:
- **Rationale:** Why this choice was made
- **Alternatives:** What was considered and rejected
- **Impact:** What parts of the system are affected
- **Timeline:** When the decision was made and by whom
- **Tags:** For easy categorization and discovery

## Real-World Scenario

### Scenario: Migrating to Microservices Architecture

**Team:** 8 developers across 3 time zones, using Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini

**Challenge:** The team needs to migrate from a monolithic application to microservices, requiring coordination on service boundaries, communication patterns, and deployment strategies.

---

### Step 1: Lead Architect Documents Decision

**Alice (Lead Architect, using Claude Code):**

```markdown
Alice: "Create a channel called 'architecture' and publish a high-priority
notification about our decision to migrate to microservices."

Claude: "I'll publish the architectural decision to the architecture channel."

# Notification sent:
{
  "channel": "architecture",
  "title": "ADR-001: Migration to Microservices Architecture",
  "body": "## Decision\n\nWe will migrate from monolith to microservices using:\n\n
  - **Service Mesh:** Istio for service communication\n- **Containerization:**
  Docker + Kubernetes\n- **Service Boundaries:** Domain-Driven Design approach\n\n
  ## Rationale\n\nCurrent monolith challenges:\n- Deployment bottlenecks\n
  - Scaling limitations\n- Team independence issues\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n
  - Modular monolith (rejected: doesn't solve deployment issues)\n- Serverless
  (rejected: team expertise gap)\n\n## Impact\n\nAffects: All backend services,
  deployment pipeline, monitoring strategy\nTimeline: 6-month phased migration",
  "priority": "high",
  "theme": "architecture-decision",
  "tags": ["microservices", "architecture", "adr", "migration"],
  "sender": {
    "user_id": "alice@company.com",
    "name": "Alice Chen",
    "role": "Lead Architect",
    "ai_tool": "Claude"
  }
}
```

---

### Step 2: Team Members Receive Notification Instantly

**Bob (Backend Developer, using ChatGPT - 3 hours later):**

```markdown
Bob: "What are the latest architecture decisions I should know about?"

ChatGPT: "Let me check the architecture channel."

# Retrieves notification from Notify-MCP
ChatGPT: "Alice published ADR-001 3 hours ago about migrating to microservices.
The team is moving to Docker + Kubernetes with Istio service mesh. Domain-Driven
Design will guide service boundaries. This affects all backend services and
requires a 6-month phased migration."

Bob: "Got it. I'll design my new feature with service boundaries in mind."
```

**Carol (DevOps Engineer, using Gemini - next day):**

```markdown
Carol: "Are there any recent architectural decisions affecting infrastructure?"

Gemini: "Yes, Alice published ADR-001 yesterday about microservices migration.
Key infrastructure impacts:
- Need Kubernetes cluster setup
- Istio service mesh implementation required
- Docker containerization for all services
- New deployment pipeline architecture

Would you like me to help plan the infrastructure changes?"

Carol: "Perfect. Let's start planning the K8s cluster."
```

---

### Step 3: Follow-up Discussions Stay Connected

**David (Frontend Developer, using Claude - 2 days later):**

```markdown
David: "I see we're moving to microservices. How does this affect frontend API calls?"

Claude: "Let me check the architecture decisions. According to ADR-001, the team
is implementing Istio service mesh. For frontend impact, you should publish a
follow-up notification asking about API gateway strategy."

# David publishes follow-up
{
  "channel": "architecture",
  "title": "Question: API Gateway Strategy for Frontend",
  "body": "Following ADR-001 (microservices migration), how should frontend
  applications consume the new services? Do we need an API gateway?",
  "priority": "medium",
  "theme": "architecture-question",
  "tags": ["microservices", "frontend", "api-gateway"],
  "thread_id": "adr-001"  # Links to original decision
}
```

**Alice responds:**

```markdown
# Notification sent:
{
  "channel": "architecture",
  "title": "ADR-002: API Gateway with Kong",
  "body": "## Decision\n\nFrontend will access services through Kong API Gateway.
  \n\n## Rationale\n\nProvides:\n- Single entry point for frontend\n- Authentication/authorization
  \n- Rate limiting\n- Request routing\n\nWorks seamlessly with Istio for backend
  service mesh.",
  "priority": "high",
  "theme": "architecture-decision",
  "tags": ["api-gateway", "kong", "frontend", "adr"],
  "thread_id": "adr-001",  # Part of same discussion thread
  "in_reply_to": "msg-12345"
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### 1. Setup Architecture Channel

```markdown
# In any AI assistant with Notify-MCP
"Create a channel called 'architecture' for technical decisions"
```

### 2. Subscribe Team Members

```markdown
# Each team member subscribes with filters
"Subscribe me to the 'architecture' channel, high and medium priority only"
```

### 3. Establish Notification Format

Use consistent tags and themes:
- **Theme:** `architecture-decision`, `architecture-question`, `architecture-change`
- **Tags:** `adr`, `microservices`, `database`, `security`, `infrastructure`
- **Priority:** `high` for major decisions, `medium` for clarifications

### 4. Document Decision Template

Include in each architectural notification:

```markdown
## Decision
What was decided

## Rationale
Why this choice was made

## Alternatives Considered
What was rejected and why

## Impact
What parts of the system are affected

## Timeline
When to implement, deadlines, phases
```

### 5. Link Related Decisions

Use threading:
- Set `thread_id` for related discussions
- Use `in_reply_to` for direct responses
- Tag with common keywords for searchability

---

## Advanced Use Cases

### Onboarding New Team Members

**New hire asks:**
```markdown
"What are the key architectural decisions I should know about?"
```

**AI assistant retrieves:**
- All `architecture-decision` notifications from last 12 months
- Filtered by `priority: high`
- Sorted chronologically to show evolution
- Complete with rationale and context

### Architecture Review Meetings

**Before meeting:**
```markdown
"List all architecture decisions from the last sprint"
```

**Result:**
- Complete record of all ADRs published
- No decisions missed or forgotten
- Discussion focuses on new topics, not rehashing known decisions

### Compliance & Auditing

**Audit request:**
```markdown
"Show all security-related architectural decisions from Q4"
```

**Notify-MCP provides:**
- Timestamped record of security decisions
- Author attribution (who decided what)
- Rationale for compliance review
- Threading showing decision evolution

---

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Do This

- **Publish decisions immediately** - Don't wait for documentation
- **Include rationale** - Future you will thank you
- **Tag consistently** - Makes searching easier
- **Link related decisions** - Use threading
- **Set appropriate priority** - High for major changes, medium for clarifications

### ‚ùå Avoid This

- **Don't skip context** - "We're using Postgres" is less useful than "We chose Postgres over MongoDB because..."
- **Don't forget alternatives** - Document what was considered and rejected
- **Don't use vague titles** - "Database Change" vs "ADR-005: Migration to PostgreSQL 15"
- **Don't ignore notifications** - Subscribe to channels relevant to your work
