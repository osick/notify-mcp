Use the notify-mcp `subscribe_to_channel` tool to subscribe to a notification channel.

Ask the user:
1. **Channel name**: Which channel to subscribe to (show available channels if needed)
2. **Priority filter** (optional): Only receive notifications with certain priorities (high, critical, etc.)
3. **Tag filter** (optional): Only receive notifications with certain tags

Then subscribe with the specified filters and confirm the subscription.
